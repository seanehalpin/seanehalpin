### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm SeÃ¡n

I'm a Product Designer working remotely from Dublin, Ireland.

Over the past 12+ years, I've worked in various areas of digital design, including front-end development, email, marketing, and app UI/UX. I'm proud to have worn many hats.

These days, I focus on leading design at GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that lets donors send money directly to the world's poorest households.
